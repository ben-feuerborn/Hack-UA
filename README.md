## INSTALL GUIDE
### IDE / Python Interpreter
Before you can start playing WORD-FLOW, you'll need something capable of running the game. Our preferred application is Visual Studio Code, which can be download [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). You're more than welcome to use any application you want, but for the sake of this guide we'll be using this one!


### Python
In order to play *WORD-FLOW* you need to have python installed. If you don't already have python installed locally to your device, you can use the following command in the VS Code terminal to download it.  
  
``` pip install python3 ```  
  
If you're uncomfortable with this method, you can download python directly from Python's own site by clicking [here](https://www.python.org/).
  
  
### Pygame
In addition to python, you'll also need pygame. Once again, you'll be able to use the following command in your terminal to download the required packages, or follow the [installation guide](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) for further explanation and resources.
  
``` pip install pygame ```  


### WORD-FLOW
Now that you have the required packages and development suite to run the game, you're almost there! If you return back to the main page for this repository there should be a green button that says **<> Code** with a little dropdown button, click it. At the bottom of the window that pops up, there is a button that says **Downlaod ZIP**. Use this button to save the game to your local device. Once this has been done, extract the ZIP file. Now open up VS Code or your preferred development application, and open the folder you just extracted. Find the file named "game.py" and open it. In the upper right corner of VS Code there is a play button, click it, and enjoy the game!

*If you have any trouble running the game, feel free to contact us, and we'd be more than happy to help!*


## HOW TO PLAY
Each puzzles gives you the beginning and end cell for each path and the starting letter for each word. The goal of the game is to connect all the paths using only the adjacent cells. Every puzzle has its own category which each word falls under. To change the color of a cell or add a letter, choose a color from the color buttons, and select the cell you want to change. Before you can continue, you must enter a letter and press enter or just press enter and come back to it! When You're all finished press the "CHECK!" button, if you're correct you get to move on, if not keep trying!

## QUICK TIPS
### Check Your Answers
Wrong cells are reset to their default, correct cells are left as they are!
  
### You Can't Pause or Check Your Answers in Writing Mode
When you give a cell a color you have to double click or press "enter" before you can continue. You'll know you're in writing mode when the buttons to pause, show and check your answers all disappear from the screen!
  
### Capitalization Doesn't Matter
We'll take whatever you got as long as its correct, so don't worry about the capitalization
  
### Skip the Letters
Start with making sure all the colors connect, than you can go back and make the letters fit the puzzle
  
### Show Answers
Everyone gets stuck sometimes! If you ever feel stuck, click the show answers buttong and go on to the next or come back at a latter time. Remember, the goal of any game is to have fun!
